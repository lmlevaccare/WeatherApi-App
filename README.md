Weather Dashboard

Using the third-party OpenWeather API I made specific queries to the URL to build a weather dashboard. This dashboard run's on the browser,uses localStorage to store any persistent data and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 

Technologies Used: 

Javascript
AJAX "Get" request using jQuery methods to retreive data from a URL database,
JSON- used to correlate keys with values,
HTML

USER STORY

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city

THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

WHEN I view the UV index

THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history

THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

WHEN I open the weather dashboard

THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
